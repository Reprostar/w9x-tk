# Windows 9x CSS toolkit (w9x-tk) 

This is a CSS toolkit/framework for styling webpage elements to look like Windows 95/98 UI.
 
All code is written in LESS, so it is possible to easily change colour scheme of all elements just by changing values in `variables.less` file.
  
### Current progress

* Buttons `.btn`
* Button groups `.btn-group` `.btn-group-horizontal`
* Fieldset `fieldset > label`

### Usage
Of course, you need to compile the sources to CSS before including this project on your page... or use any JavaScript client-side compiler to do this job on every page display (greetings for your non-JS visitors :] ).

```
<div class="w9x-tk">

    <!-- All (supported) elements there will get a nice retro look -->
    
</div>
```

Please refer to `demo.html` file for example usages of specific components.
